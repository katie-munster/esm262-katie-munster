#### Overall Contract

Goal: Calculate total carbon dioxide emissions from UCSBâ€™s transportation system (cars, buses, trucks, golf carts, boats?) per year

Input: number of vehicles of each type, average mileage of each type of vehicle per year

Parameters: fuel efficiency (MPG), CO2 emissions per unit of energy source (standard gasoline, diesel gasoline)

Output: Total CO2 emissions for the UCSB transportation system

Modules: 
Module 1: calculate total fuel usage per vehicle type
Module 2: calculate total emissions per vehicle type
Module 3: calculate total transportation emissions
Module 4: calculate total cost of fuel per vehicle type
Module 5: calculate total cost of all fuel for UCSB

#### Module 1: Calculate total fuel usage per vehicle type per year

Equation: Total fuel usage = (number of vehicles*average miles traveled per year) / (fuel efficiency)

Input: number of vehicles, average mileage of vehicles per year (miles)

Parameter: fuel efficiency (MPG)

Output: total fuel usage (gallons) per year


#### Module 2: Calculate CO2 emissions per vehicle type

Equation: Emissions for vehicle type = (Total fuel usage) * (CO2 emissions per unit fuel)

Input: Module 1 result (total fuel usage)

Parameter: CO2 emissions per unit fuel per year

Output: Total emissions for one vehicle type per year


#### Module 3: Total CO2 emissions of UCSB transportation system

Equation: Total emissions = Sum(Emissions for each vehicle type)

Input: Module 2 results (total CO2 emissions for one vehicle type per year)

Output: sum of total emissions from UCSB transportation system per year


#### Module 4: Calculate cost of fuel per vehicle type

Equation: Cost of fuel for vehicle type = (Total fuel usage) * (Cost per unit fuel)

Input: Module 1 results (total fuel usage)

Parameter: Cost per unit fuel

Output: Cost of fuel for one vehicle type per year


#### Module 5: Total cost of UCSB fuel used for transportation

Equation: Total cost = Sum(Cost of fuel for each vehicle type)

Input: Module 4 results (cost of fuel per UCSB vehicle type per year)

Output: total cost of UCSB fuel for transportation per year
